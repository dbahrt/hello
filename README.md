# hello
This is a sample git repo.

The "hello_world" program is my default starting point for just about
every application that I write.  I find that it is easier to modify a
working program than it is to write one from scratch.

In teaching programming, I encourage my students to always start with
something that they know works.  Ideally, they would seed the process
with a program that approximates the programming assignment, be it a
sample windows user interface program, a sample file maintenance program,
or a sample report program.  At the very least, I suggest that they
start with the hello_world program.  hello_world is the most simple
console application: it starts up receiving inputs from the command line,
it displays a message on the console, and it terminates outputting
the Main() function return value into an environment variable.  

The hello_world application demonstrates that my toolset is at least
minimally functional.  In conjuction with conditional assertion checking,
its Console.WriteLine() function is my preferred debugging tool.
